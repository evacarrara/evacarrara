On my [repository](https://github.com/evacarrara/republatfrags) I've posted my work in progress but the text is much more usable than when I got it. I explain a bit about the structure of the ancient work below, the cleaning process/structure of the plain text, and give an example of the possibilities of enriching the plain text. If you've found this page, feel free to use the plain text, but please credit me!

## Nonius' *De Compendiosa Doctrina*

Nonius writes a dictionary of Republican Latin in the 4th C CE in 20 books; the first twelve cover lexical and grammatical topics, while the last eight cover topics like 'Words for Clothing'. The plain text follows Wallace Lindsay's 1903 Teubner edition in 3 volumes (Bks 1-3, 4, and 5-20), facsimiles of which can be found on Hathitrust for [Vol. 1](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/umn.319510023264422), [Vol. 2](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/umn.31951d00803858t), and [Vol. 3](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/umn.319510023264430). See Zetzel's 2018 *Critics, Compilers, and Commentators* 98-100 for a brief overview of the dictionary.

## Structure of the plain text

* I've retained the volume divisions of Lindsay's edition for now. 
* For ease of use I've removed page headers, front and back matter, and the app crit from this version.
* Lines are meant to correspond to either:
	* headwords or topics (for book 9 on number and case)
	* Nonian books (INCIPIT DE...)
	* or letter divisions (INCIPIT PER...)
* Mercier page numbers are retained for reference and bracketed like <<& 1. 2 M. &>>

As of now, the texts have my internal markers (see on the repo readme) but I plan on removing them for accessibility. I have certainly not caught everything that should be a headword, nor is all the Latin great, and one major task I'll undertake soon is rendering the Greek into...Greek. But for now, if you can read Latin, the texts are probably okay to use.

## Sample Enrichment

Obviously a super long term project, but something like this would be a cool way to make Nonius accessible (contrary to what it seems, I've had a lot of fun reading Nonius and can hopefully incorporate some of this into my diss).

### From Book V: On the Difference between Similar Meanings

[MORATA](https://logeion.uchicago.edu/moratus), quod est morigera, et [MOROSA](https://logeion.uchicago.edu/morosus) hanc habent distantiam, quod morosa est contrariis et perversis moribus. 

[Afranius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Afranius_(poet)) Vopisco (372): dum morigeram, dum morosam praebeo, deinde aliquid dedita opera controversiae concmno, laedo interdum contumeliis. 
	
[M. Tullius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero) de Senectute [(65)](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0038%3Asection%3D65): 'at sunt morosi et anxii et iracundi et difficiles senes'.

[Plautus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plautus) Aulularia (239): dum modo morata recte veniat, dotata est satis.

Something like this is good because Nonius cites so many lesser known authors (like Afranius), so linking out to Wiki or another source is useful, whereas linking to the Perseus text of Cicero allows you to move between both contexts of the 'fragment'.
