My major project (dissertation aside) right now is the transformation and cleaning of a plain text version of Lindsay's 1903 edition of Nonius Marcellus' *De Compendiosa Doctrina* into usable data on citation of Republican authors. Most of my data is on Github [here](https://github.com/evacarrara/republatfrags). Continue to browse through the newer posts for updates and discussion :)
