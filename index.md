Welcome! I'm Eva, and you've found my site for experimenting in computational methods as a 'classically' trained ancient historian and teacher. My main project has been to develop a usable plain text version of Nonius Marcellus' *Dictionary of Republican Latin* to tabularize, quantify, and otherwise analyze. You can find out more about how it's going on my blog. I've also been slowly building a [repository](https://github.com/evacarrara/republatfrags) of texts and code used to examine citation in later Latin lexicographers and grammarians. 

You can find out more here [about me](https://evacarrara.github.io/evacarrara/about/) and my love of Florida wildlife.
