# Negotium 

I'm a sixth year PhD candidate in Classics at Florida State University. My main academic interests are Greek and Roman historiography, Roman cultural history and ancient sex and gender. My dissertation offers a broad overview of Cicero's engagement with Cato the Elder, and then explores what effect this citation context of Cato's fragments has had on our modern perceptions of his own historical style and sources. On this site I post some of my preliminary data, results, and musings from a project that aims to consider Nonius Marcellus as recorder of fragmentary history in a similar vein.

# Otium

Other interests of mine: powerlifting, alligator spotting, kayaking, reading, and painting. Two cats frequently appear in my Zoom classes, Terry Gross and Meatball. Bonus cat content:
