# *Negotium* 

Hello! I'm Eva, a lecturer of Classics at the University of Arizona. I completed my PhD in Classics at Florida State University. My main academic interests are Greek and Roman historiography, Roman cultural history and ancient sex and gender. My dissertation, the basis for [first book project](https://evacarrara.github.io/evacarrara/research/), offers a broad overview of Cicero's engagement with Cato the Elder, and then explores what effect this citation context of Cato's fragments has had on our modern perceptions of his own historical style and sources. On this [site](https://evacarrara.github.io/evacarrara/blog/) I post some of my preliminary data, results, and musings from a project that aims to consider Nonius Marcellus as recorder of fragmentary history in a similar vein. I have been a bit behind lately with the Nonius project between moving and taking a well-deserved rest after graduate school, but hope to have new posts soon.
