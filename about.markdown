# Negotium 

I'm a fifth year PhD candidate in Classics at Florida State University. My main academic interests are Greek and Roman historiography, Roman cultural history and ancient sex and gender. My dissertation researches the historiography of the Roman Republic by reexamining the fragments of Cato in citation context. On this site I post some of my preliminary and middle results, experiments with computational methods, etc. I completed an MA in Greek and Latin at Villanova University in 2016.

# Otium

Other interests and pursuits of mine are powerlifting, alligator spotting, kayaking, reading (non-Classically), and visual art. Two cats frequently appear in my Zoom classes, Terry Gross and Meatball. Bonus cat content:
