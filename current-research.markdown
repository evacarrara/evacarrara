# Abstract: Cato in Cicero: Reading Roman History in the Late Republic

My dissertation explores Cicero’s reception of Cato the Censor’s fragmentary history of Rome and Italy, the *Origines*. I raise the question of how such a text can be said to continue to exist in fragmented form, and to what—or to whom—it owes that existence. I revisit commonly held conceptions about Cato’s style, aims, and influences which I argue are owed more to the transmission history of the fragments than to Cato’s intent and authorial agency. I argue that readers, including Cicero’s audience and Cicero himself, fundamentally shape Cato’s image as a historian. I rely on philological and digital methodologies to catalog and analyze all of Cicero’s engagement with Cato’s writings. In a departure from previous approaches to the research problem, which center authorial intent and/or remove Cato’s fragments from their transmission context to be studied, I focus on reader responses to Cicero’s Cato. I view Cicero’s citation of Cato as form of reading. Moreover, many readers and writers in the Late Republic were interested in Cato. By understanding the fictionalized interlocutors in Cicero’s dialogues as an internal audience analogous to Cicero’s readers, we can better understand the reception of Cato the Elder. Relying on scholarship which suggests citations provoke skeptical reader responses to analyze references to Cato’s writings, sayings, and speeches. I suggest this approach allows us to better think about the place of the earliest Latin histories in the cultural and intellectual history of the Roman world.

My dissertation contains five chapters, an introduction, and a conclusion. My first chapter lays out an overview of Cicero’s reference to and citation of Cato throughout his career. Building on this foundation, the second chapter explores how Cicero tends to name Cato in groups with other famous Romans and Greeks. I argue that this tendency reflects Cato’s multivalence as a generation and culture bridging persona, but also that it helps to designate Cato as the first orator and historian worth reading in Cicero’s speeches and rhetorical works. In the next chapter, I offer a case study in how the goals of the citing authority alter our conceptions of Cato’s most famous historical method, antonomasia, or omission of personal names. I focus on Cato and dialogic verisimilitude in *De re publica*. In the last two chapters I discuss his *De Senectute*, the dialogue delivered in Cato’s voice written late in Cicero’s life. In the penultimate chapter I explore how Cicero’s use of citation, historical example, and literary history in the dialogue shape our understanding of Cato, whose *Origines* are cited in the dialogue. Finally, I end with a case study that argues that Cicero in this dialogue and elsewhere is ultimately responsible for the tradition that Cato’s histories were influenced by Xenophon. Thus, I conclude that Cicero’s citation of Cato has had not just profound influence on Cicero’s literary career or Cato’s legacy, but our very understanding of the origins of Roman history.
